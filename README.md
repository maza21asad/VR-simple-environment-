# VR Simple Environment

Welcome to VR Simple Environment, a small project developed as part of a Virtual Reality (VR) course. This project allows users to interact with various 3D objects and navigate through the environment in a virtual reality setting.

## Assets

1. **GoogleVR**: The project utilizes the GoogleVR SDK for VR development.
2. **Materials**: Various materials are included to provide different visual properties to objects in the environment. Some examples include Blue.mat, Black.mat, Brown.mat, etc.
3. **Prefabs**: Prefabricated objects are included for easy instantiation in the scene. Prefabs such as Capsule.prefab, Cube.prefab, and Cylinder.prefab are available.
4. **Screen**: The main scene of the project is SampleScene.unity.
5. **Scripts**: Several scripts are provided to implement different functionalities within the environment:
   - **ChangeColor.cs**: Allows objects to change color upon interaction.
   - **ExitGame.cs**: Handles the functionality for exiting the game.
   - **HoldObj.cs**: Enables the user to hold objects within the VR environment.
   - **ObjInraction.cs**: Manages interactions with objects.
   - **PlayerWalk.cs**: Facilitates player movement within the environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with VR Simple Environment, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a VR headset and compatible hardware.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Load the SampleScene.unity scene to begin exploring the environment.
4. Interact with objects using the provided scripts and functionalities.
5. Navigate through the environment using VR controls.

## Usage

- **Interacting with Objects**: Use VR controllers to interact with objects. Depending on the script attached to the object, you may be able to change their color, hold them, or trigger other interactions.
- **Navigating the Environment**: Move around the environment using the provided VR locomotion controls. Use the PlayerWalk script to enable movement within the VR space.
- **Exiting the Game**: Trigger the ExitGame functionality to exit the VR application.
